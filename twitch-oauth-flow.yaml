1: Send the user you want to authenticate to your registered redirect URI. 
   Then, an authorization page will ask the user to sign up or log into Twitch 
   and allow the user to choose whether to authorize your application/identity system.

  - GET https://id.twitch.tv/oauth2/authorize
    ?client_id=<your-client-ID>
    &redirect_uri=<your-registered-redirect-URI>
    &response_type=code
    &scope=<space-separated-list-of-scopes>

2: If the user authorizes your application, the user is redirected to your redirect URI, with an authorization code

  - https://<your registered redirect URI>/?code=<authorization code>

3: The OAuth 2.0 authorization code is a 30-character, randomly generated string. 
   It is used in the next step, a request made to the token endpoint in exchange for an access token

   - http://localhost/
    ?code=394a8bc98028f39660e53025de824134fb46313
    &scope=viewing_activity_read
    &state=c3ab8aa609ea11e793ae92361f002671

4: On your server, get an access token by making this request

  - POST https://id.twitch.tv/oauth2/token
    ?client_id=<your-client-ID>
    &client_secret=<your-client-secret>
    &code=<authorization-code-received-above>
    &grant_type=authorization_code
    &redirect_uri=<your-registered-redirect-URI>

  - response:
  - {
      "access_token": "<user access token>",
      "refresh_token": "<refresh token>",
      "expires_in": <number of seconds until the token expires>,
      "scope": ["<your previously listed scope(s)>"],
      "token_type": "bearer"
    }

5: To allow for applications to remain authenticated for long periods in a world of expiring tokens, we allow for sessions to be refreshed
   Generally, refresh tokens are used to extend the lifetime of a given authorization
   To refresh a token, you need an access token/refresh token pair coming from a body. For example

  - POST https://id.twitch.tv/oauth2/token
    --data-urlencode
    ?grant_type=refresh_token
    &refresh_token=<your-refresh-token>
    &client_id=<your-client-ID>
    &client_secret=<your-client-secret>
